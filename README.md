Kingsland Academy Individual Defense Project 2018<br>
This is the project development record for the Kingsland Blockchain course individual defense<br>
Project idea is to implement a confidential record holding system, which is exemplified by the idea of a will written and stored confidentially at a trusted site such that the beneficiaries can only access the will after certain registration process, and yet the trusted site itself is also not able to access the content<br>
As this is a individual project defense, no other contributors are enabled currently.
